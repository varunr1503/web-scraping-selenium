# web-scraping-selenium
Learnt how scrap data using python's selenium library
The website I scapped the data from is - https://www.adamchoi.co.uk/teamgoals/detailed
learnt how to select options in the page or even on the drop down menu and then scrap the data
It's important to inspect the elements precisely while scarping data
I further stored the data in a csv file using pandas
